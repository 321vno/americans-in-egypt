    Welcome to Khedival American Soldiers, a comprehensive digital collection dedicated to preserving the works of 48 American Civil War veterans who served in the Egyptian Army from 1869-1879. Ranging from explorers to engineers, from sixty year-old veterans to twenty-year old captains, and from Union to Confederate affiliations, this website captures the lives of 48 soldiers who lived fascinating lives. Each soldier has his own folder filled with photographs, published works, and manuscripts as well. These items vary as much as their owners do, including, but not limited to: memoirs, diaries, scientific articles, reconnaissance reports, and fictional tales. 


    There are currently 24 out of the 48 soldiers to be found on this site. As this is an ongoing project, I will add soldiers as I find more information about them. In the meantime, users can use the Browse function to find specific soldiers, use the Map page to discover where they traveled, and peruse the Timeline page to see the scope of the project. To see what sources I used for this project, you can go to the Scholarship page. To learn more about the project itself and who I am, please go to the About page.


    These soldiers were products of their time. Some vocabulary found in their writing is a reflection of nineteenth-century Western attitudes. While these American soldiers did not go to Egypt to colonize the nation or gain economic power, some of their interactions with the local people can be seen as offensive in our modern day.
